<h3>ABOUT HUB FOOTWEAR</h3>
<P>
        Since its foundation in 2004, HUB has remained focused on its main objective,
        to only design high-quality footwear that is truly timeless. The brand represents 
        an athletic, metropolitan lifestyle, combined with a clean, minimalist appearance. 
        An attitude and style that is expressed clearly throughout each collection. HUB’s 
        founder Huub van Boeckel, a former professional tennis player, never lost his strong 
        mentality or his love for sneakers – which inspired him to start developing his own 
        sneaker. Each season, these characteristics are closely observed and will serve as an 
        inspiration to reinvent some of the classic designs, resulting in a must-have for the 
        next season.Materials, patterns, style and subtle details are all reworked in order to
        create a unique range of clean, minimalist styles, thus staying true to the roots and 
        ideals of this Dutch firm.
