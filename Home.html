  <div class="box">INTRODUCTION Since its foundation in 2004, HUB has remained focused on its main objective, to only design high quality
    footwear that is truly timeless. The brand represents an athletic, metropolitan lifestyle, combined with a clean, minimalist
    appearance. An attitude and style that is expressed clearly throughout each collection. HUB’s founder Huub van Boeckel,
    a former professional tennis player, never lost his strong mentality or his love for sneakers – which inspired him to
    start developing his own sneaker. Each season, these characteristics are closely observed and will serve as inspiration
    to reinvent some of the classic designs, resulting in a must-have for the next season.
