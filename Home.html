     Since its foundation in 2004, HUB has remained focused on its main objective, 
     to only design high quality footwear that is truly timeless. The brand represents 
     an athletic, metropolitan lifestyle, combined with a clean, minimalist appearance. 
     An attitude and style that is expressed clearly throughout each collection. HUB’s 
     founder Huub van Boeckel, a former professional tennis player, never lost his strong 
     mentality or his love for sneakers – which inspired him to start developing his own 
     sneaker. Each season, these characteristics are closely observed and will serve as 
     inspiration to reinvent some of the classic designs, resulting in a must-have for 
     the next season.
